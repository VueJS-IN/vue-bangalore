- title: A Vue.js DevTools Primer

  description: We explore the various development-time features that the Vue.js DevTools provides ranging from inspecting our Vue.js component tree, finding state changes in Vuex and Vue Router and inspecting performance issues. There's a wealth of information here that is essential for every Vue.js developer to be fully productive at their work and this talk aims to demystify all these features.
