    type: talk
    description: |
      Modern web frameworks and architecture heavily relies on the main/ui thread and any expensive computation done with Javascript can block the main thread causing slow pages, unresponsive feedbacks and lagging. In this talk we'll explore ways we can optimize our vue applications with best practices and utilising available options to spawn web workers to offload task off from the main thread.
    speaker: Musthaq Ahamad <@haxzie_>
