  bio: a tech-focused job platform, on a mission to get every developer a great job. We believe developers should have all the information they need to choose a job they love whether that’s based on a cutting-edge tech stack, an inspiring team or just good old-fashioned salary. In our world, that means no more spam and empty promises from headhunters, no more sending the same application to multiple companies - just one profile and the choice to receive honest offers related to your job preferences direct from companies.
